# Building a Modern Blog with MDX

MDX is a fantastic format that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of JSX. It's perfect for creating rich, interactive blog content.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can:

- Write content in Markdown
- Import and use React components
- Create interactive examples
- Build reusable content blocks

## Basic MDX Syntax

MDX supports all standard Markdown syntax:

### Headings

Use `#` for headings (shown above)

### Lists

**Unordered lists:**
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

**Ordered lists:**
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Code Blocks

Inline code like `const greeting = "Hello"` is easy to add.

Block code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
  return `Welcome to MDX`
}

greet('Developer')
```

### Blockquotes

> "MDX is the perfect blend of content and code."
> - A happy developer

## Using React Components in MDX

The real power of MDX comes from embedding React components:

```mdx
import { CustomComponent } from './components'

# My Post

Here's some regular Markdown content.

<CustomComponent prop="value" />

And more Markdown after the component!
```

## Styling MDX Content

You can customize how MDX elements render by providing custom components:

```tsx
const components = {
  h1: ({ children }) => (
    <h1 className="custom-heading">{children}</h1>
  ),
  code: ({ children }) => (
    <code className="custom-code">{children}</code>
  )
}

<MDXRemote source={content} components={components} />
```

## Processing MDX in Next.js

Here's how to set up MDX processing:

```tsx
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

export default function BlogPost({ content }) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      source={content}
      options={{
        mdxOptions: {
          rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight]
        }
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Frontmatter for Metadata

Add metadata to your MDX files using frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Awesome Post"
date: "2024-03-05"
author: "Developer"
tags: ["MDX", "React"]
---
```

Parse it with gray-matter:

```typescript
import matter from 'gray-matter'

const { data, content } = matter(fileContent)
console.log(data.title) // "My Awesome Post"
```

## Benefits of Using MDX

1. **Content and Code Together** - Write documentation with live examples
2. **Type Safety** - Use TypeScript with your content
3. **Component Reuse** - Share components across posts
4. **Rich Formatting** - Combine Markdown simplicity with React power

## Conclusion

MDX bridges the gap between content and code, making it ideal for technical blogs, documentation, and interactive articles. Start using MDX in your next project and experience the difference!

Happy writing! ✨
